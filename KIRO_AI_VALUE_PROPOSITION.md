## Time & Cost Analysis

### LLM Cost Calculation Methodology

**Estimated Token Usage for This Project:**
- Input tokens: ~500,000 tokens (reading code, context, specifications)
- Output tokens: ~200,000 tokens (generating code, documentation, tests)
- Total: ~700,000 tokens

**LLM Pricing (Industry Average):**
- Input: ~$0.01 per 1K tokens
- Output: ~$0.03 per 1K tokens

**Calculation:**
- Input cost: 500K × $0.01/1K = $5
- Output cost: 200K × $0.03/1K = $6
- **Total LLM Cost: $11-25** (depending on model and provider)

This represents the actual computational cost of using Kiro AI, not including:
- Human supervision time (4-6 hours, but redeployed to strategic work)
- Kiro platform subscription (if applicable)
- Infrastructure costs (minimal)

### Traditional Development Approach (Human-Only)

| Phase | Estimated Time | Developer Rate | Cost |
|-------|---------------|----------------|------|
| Requirements Gathering | 8 hours | $150/hr | $1,200 |
| System Design | 16 hours | $150/hr | $2,400 |
| Data Pipeline Development | 24 hours | $150/hr | $3,600 |
| Analysis Engine Development | 40 hours | $150/hr | $6,000 |
| Dashboard Development | 32 hours | $150/hr | $4,800 |
| Testing & QA | 24 hours | $150/hr | $3,600 |
| Documentation | 8 hours | $150/hr | $1,200 |
| Bug Fixes & Refinement | 16 hours | $150/hr | $2,400 |
| **TOTAL** | **168 hours** | | **$25,200** |

**Timeline:** 4-5 weeks (assuming 1 developer)

### Kiro AI-Assisted Development

| Phase | Human Time | LLM Cost* | Total Cost | Savings |
|-------|------------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Complete System Development | 4-6 hours | $15-25 | $15-25 | $25,175-25,185 |
| **Savings Percentage** | **96-97% faster** | **99.9% cheaper** | **99.9% cheaper** | **~$25,180** |

*Estimated LLM API costs based on token usage (input/output tokens at typical Claude/GPT-4 rates)
